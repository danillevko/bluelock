        <section id="nagi">
            <h2>Nagi Seishiro</h2>
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Nagi is initially laid-back, aloof, and detached from soccer. However, his
                natural talent and competitive edge are gradually uncovered as he becomes more involved in the sport.
                His calm demeanor hides a sharp, calculating mind, and he plays the game with exceptional intuition.</p>
            <p><strong>Development:</strong> Nagi evolves from someone who treats soccer as a hobby into someone who
                craves improvement and competition. His development is heavily influenced by his partnership with Reo,
                which helps him realize the true value of striving for perfection.</p>
            <p><strong>Traits:</strong> Nagi’s exceptional natural talent allows him to read the game and execute
                complex plays with remarkable precision. Despite his laid-back attitude, he thrives in competitive
                environments. His cool and collected nature under pressure is one of his defining qualities.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Moments:</strong> Nagi's transformation occurs during key matches where he has to fight
                through his fear of failure and embrace his competitive side. His collaboration with Reo plays a pivotal
                role in his growth as a player.</p>

        <section id="isagi">
            <h2>Isagi Yoichi</h2>
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Isagi starts as an average player, lacking the standout physical traits of
                others. However, his exceptional spatial awareness and understanding of the game set him apart. He is
                driven by his desire to become the best and is constantly refining his abilities to outsmart his
                opponents.</p>
            <p><strong>Development:</strong> Isagi’s journey is one of self-improvement. Despite lacking the raw
                athleticism of other players, he uses his mind to surpass his physical limitations. His growth involves
                learning from others, adapting to different styles of play, and trusting his instincts.</p>
            <p><strong>Traits:</strong> Tactical genius, exceptional mental game, and a keen ability to anticipate
                plays. Isagi excels in creating space and positioning himself strategically to capitalize on
                opportunities. His adaptability makes him a formidable opponent.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Moments:</strong> A defining moment for Isagi is when he taps into his full potential by
                mastering his spatial awareness and mental strength. He begins to trust his instincts more and becomes
                more confident in his ability to compete with the best.</p>
        </section>


        <section id="sae">
            <h2>Sae Itoshi</h2>
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Sae embodies the ultimate soccer talent, radiating confidence and
                arrogance. He is one of the top players in the Blue Lock project and is used to being at the top of his
                game. His cold, ruthless attitude often isolates him, but he uses his dominant skills to control the
                field.</p>
            <p><strong>Development:</strong> Sae’s growth is more about refining his mental fortitude rather than
                improving his raw skills. His journey involves realizing that being the best requires more than just
                physical ability—it requires the right mindset, mental strength, and the ability to work with others.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Traits:</strong> Sae is known for his superior physical prowess, precision, and ability to
                dominate any situation. His competitive nature and unyielding confidence make him a force to be reckoned
                with, but they also create a barrier when it comes to collaboration with others.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Moments:</strong> Sae’s internal conflict arises when he faces the limits of his ego and
                learns that true greatness requires teamwork and resilience. His journey is about finding balance
                between his arrogance and his need to evolve as a player.</p>
        </section>


        <section id="rin">
            <h2>Rin Itoshi</h2>
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Rin is the embodiment of an intense and driven individual. He’s
                laser-focused on his goals, with an unwavering belief in his own abilities. His cold and distant
                demeanor often makes him appear as a loner, but it’s driven by his need to perfect his craft and surpass
                his brother, Sae.</p>
            <p><strong>Development:</strong> Rin’s growth centers on his internal conflict. He initially sees soccer as
                a solitary pursuit of perfection, with little regard for the importance of teamwork. Over time, he
                learns that collaboration can enhance his own abilities and lead him to even greater heights.</p>
            <p><strong>Traits:</strong> Rin’s physical attributes and skill set are outstanding. He is agile, quick, and
                possesses a high level of technical ability. His relentless drive to surpass his brother Sae makes him a
                formidable opponent, but his journey teaches him the value of relationships and teamwork.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Moments:</strong> Rin’s key moments revolve around his rivalry with Sae, his realization of
                the importance of teamwork, and his growing respect for others as they become his allies in the pursuit
                of perfection.</p>
